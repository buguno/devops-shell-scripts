## Shell Script Standards

### General Guidelines

- Use `#!/bin/bash` as the shebang line
- Include proper error handling

### Script Structure

#!/bin/bash

# Script name and brief description
# Usage: ./script-name.sh [options]

# Exit on error
set -e

# Main script logic
```

### Best Practices

   - Use `set -e` to exit on error
   - Check for required dependencies
   - Validate input parameters
   - Provide meaningful error messages

2. **Documentation**

   - Document all functions
   - Add usage examples
   - Update README.md if necessary

3. **Testing**
   - Test scripts with different scenarios
   - Include edge cases
   - Verify error handling
   - Test on different environments if possible
